# Snake-Game



## Introduction

Matrix project for Introduction to Robotics course, University of Bucharest. The project consists in creating a game on the 8x8 matrix with a menu displayed on the LCD display. The game I chose is Snake

## Backstory
Snake is a classic game loved by everyone. Despite the simplicity of the premise, Snake can banish boredom and bring back nostalgia.

##How to play
Using the joystick to move the snake on the matrix, the goal is to eat as musch food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake itself

## Game description
The game has 3 levels :

• Easy: the speed is low and constant, after 3 points the level increases

• Medium: the speed increases with every point and the points double. After 2 points you can reach the next level

• Hard: speed doubles with each food eaten
